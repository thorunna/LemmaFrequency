# LemmaFrequency

Scripts for extracting information on lemmas in three Icelandic corpora: [The Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus](https://clarin.is/en/resources/icepahc/) (IcePaHC), the [Tagged Icelandic Corpus](https://clarin.is/en/resources/mim/) (M√çM) and the [Icelandic Gigaword Corpus](http://igc.arnastofnun.is) (RMH).

The scripts are all stored in the [scripts](https://github.com/thorunna/LemmaFrequency/tree/main/scripts) directory, which is divided further into directories for each corpus. Two scripts are available for each corpus:

- `*corpus*_simple_freq.py` returns a tsv file containing a lemma, its word category, along with the gender if the word in question is a noun, and its frequency, in a descending order.
- `*corpus*_get_lemma_freq.py` returns a tsv file containing frequency information based on each sentence in the corpus. The information shown includes sentence IDs, text genre, the sentence text, and a frequency vector. Further information on the output, along with instructions on how to run the script, can be found in the script itself.

The scripts' output files are stored under the [output](https://github.com/thorunna/LemmaFrequency/tree/main/output) directory. Some files cannot be stored in the repository due to size limitations, so a download link is provided instead.
